## üö® CRITICAL: Partner Linking & Data Integrity Issues

**Status**: Blocking production use
**Analysis**: See [PARTNER_LINKING_ANALYSIS.md](./PARTNER_LINKING_ANALYSIS.md) for full details

###Critical Issues Identified (Oct 21, 2025)

1. **No Automatic Partner Linking** - Users who sign up with invited email are NOT automatically linked
2. **Orphaned Decisions** - Old decisions from missing partners cannot be deleted
3. **Data Cleanup Needed** - Current user has orphaned/invalid data

### üî¥ Priority 1: Fix Partner Linking (BLOCKING)

- [x] **Migration 012: Automatic Partner Linking** ‚úÖ READY TO APPLY
  - [x] Enhance `handle_new_user()` trigger to check for pending invitations
  - [x] Auto-link user2_id when email matches pending_partner_email
  - [x] Update new user's couple_id
  - [x] Clear pending_partner_email after linking
  - [x] Add logging for debugging
  - [x] Update existing decisions with correct partner_id
  - **File**: `supabase/migrations/012_automatic_partner_linking.sql`

- [x] **Migration 013: Data Cleanup & Policy Updates** ‚úÖ READY TO APPLY
  - [x] Add `cleanup_orphaned_decisions()` function
  - [x] Add `get_couple_info()` debug function
  - [x] Update DELETE policy to allow couple members (not just creators)
  - **File**: `supabase/migrations/013_cleanup_and_policy_updates.sql`

- [x] **Migration Guide Created** ‚úÖ
  - See `supabase/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS**:
1. Apply migrations via Supabase Dashboard (see MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Run `SELECT * FROM get_couple_info();` to check your status
3. Run `SELECT * FROM cleanup_orphaned_decisions();` to clean up
4. Test partner linking flow with two accounts

- [ ] **Apply Migrations to Database**
  - [ ] Apply Migration 012 via Supabase Dashboard
  - [ ] Apply Migration 013 via Supabase Dashboard
  - [ ] Verify migrations succeeded

- [ ] **Data Cleanup**
  - [ ] Run `get_couple_info()` to check orphaned count
  - [ ] Run `cleanup_orphaned_decisions()` if needed
  - [ ] Verify orphaned_count is 0

- [ ] **Test End-to-End Partner Flow**
  - [ ] User A signs up, creates couple with partner email
  - [ ] User B signs up with invited email
  - [ ] Verify auto-linking works
  - [ ] Verify both see shared decisions
  - [ ] Verify both can delete decisions
