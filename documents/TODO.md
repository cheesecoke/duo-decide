**Task 1 & 2: User Profiles and Voting (CRITICAL FIXES)**

- [x] Add profile fetching to database.ts (`getProfileById`, `getProfilesByCouple`)
- [x] Update UserContext to include `userName` and `partnerName`
- [x] Remove mock data dependency from index.tsx (USERS.YOU, USERS.PARTNER)
- [x] Display real user names from profiles table

- [x] Vote privacy controls (hide votes until both complete round)
- [x] Creator blocking in Round 3 of polls

**Task 4: Decision Completion**

- [x] Add `completeDecision` function
- [x] Add current_round field to Decision type

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing

### ðŸš§ In Progress - Remaining Tasks

**Next Priority: Integrate and Test**

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming (After Migration Complete)

- [ ] Test voting flows with real data
  - [ ] Vote mode: Single-round voting
  - [ ] Poll mode: Multi-round polling (Rounds 1-3)

## Known Issues

### Blockers

- None currently

### Bugs

- [ ] Web: `useNativeDriver` warning (expected, falls back to JS animations)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Impact**: Minor performance on web
  - **Fix**: Accept as limitation or implement web-specific animations

### UI Issues

- [ ] SVG icons have DOM property warnings on web
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Impact**: Console noise only, no functional impact
  - **Fix**: Update icon library or create web-compatible versions
