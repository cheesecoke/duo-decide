# Temporary Auth Persistence Solution

## Overview

This document describes the temporary authentication persistence solution implemented to keep users logged in during development refreshes. **This is NOT a production-ready solution and should be replaced before deploying to production.**

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Storage Strategy (`config/supabase.ts`)

- **Web Development**: Uses both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for redundancy
  - `localStorage` persists across browser sessions
  - `sessionStorage` persists during current session
  - Fallback mechanisms if storage access fails
- **Native Development**: Uses secure encrypted storage via `expo-secure-store`
- **Token Refresh**: Extended refresh threshold (60 seconds) for development

### 2. Improved Session Management (`context/supabase-provider.tsx`)

- Enhanced session initialization with error handling
- Session recovery mechanisms for development
- Additional helper functions: `refreshSession()` and `checkAuthState()`
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Development Debug Tools

- Auth debug overlay in header (web only)
- Session state monitoring and logging
- Manual session refresh and auth state checking

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Temporary)

- ✅ Encrypted storage for native platforms
- ✅ Secure token handling via Supabase
- ⚠️ Web storage uses standard browser APIs (not encrypted)
- ⚠️ Extended token refresh for development convenience

### Production Requirements (To Implement)

- [ ] Implement proper session encryption for web
- [ ] Add session timeout and automatic logout
- [ ] Implement proper token rotation
- [ ] Add biometric authentication options
- [ ] Implement proper session validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting for auth attempts
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Usage

### During Development

The auth persistence should now work automatically. Users will remain logged in after:

- Page refreshes
- Browser restarts (web)
- App backgrounding/foregrounding (native)

### Debug Tools (Development Only)

- **Web**: Look for the "Auth Debug (Dev)" overlay in the top-right corner
- **Console**: Check for auth-related logs
- **Manual Testing**: Use the debug buttons to test session refresh

## Files Modified

1. `config/supabase.ts` - Enhanced storage and auth configuration
2. `context/supabase-provider.tsx` - Improved session management
3. `components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added debug overlay (web only)

## Testing the Solution

1. **Sign in** to your application
2. **Refresh the page** - you should remain logged in
3. **Close and reopen the browser** (web) - session should persist
4. **Background/foreground the app** (native) - session should persist

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Session still lost on refresh**: Check browser console for storage errors
- **Debug overlay not showing**: Ensure you're in development mode (`__DEV__` is true)
- **Native auth issues**: Check Expo SecureStore permissions

### Debug Steps

1. Check console logs for auth initialization messages
2. Use the debug overlay to manually refresh/check auth state
3. Verify storage is working in browser dev tools (web)
4. Check native logs for storage errors

## Removal Before Production

### Files to Clean Up

- Remove debug overlay from `Header.tsx`
- Remove development helper functions from `supabase-provider.tsx`
- Remove development logging and monitoring
- Remove extended token refresh settings

### Security Hardening

- Implement proper session encryption
- Add session timeout mechanisms
- Implement proper error handling
- Add rate limiting and security headers
- Remove debug logging and development features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the current implementation during development
2. **Short-term**: Identify any remaining edge cases or issues
3. **Medium-term**: Design and implement production auth persistence
4. **Long-term**: Add additional security features (2FA, biometrics, etc.)

## Notes

- This solution prioritizes development convenience over security
- All temporary code is marked with `// TEMPORARY:` comments
- The solution handles both web and native platforms
- Session recovery mechanisms are more aggressive in development mode

Remember: **This is a temporary development solution. Do not deploy to production without implementing proper security measures.**
